I"´<p>So, this is it. After the dozens of ads researched, the CVs sent, the â€œYeah we donâ€™t need you right now, weâ€™ll call you if we do though, xoxoâ€ and the Skype interviews, someone was willing to give me an opportunity. And Iâ€™d be damned if I didnâ€™t grasp it with all I had. The contract conditions were good, the environment seemed awesome, and the work seemed exactly what I was looking for, so fate arranged my first day of work.
Look up. Straighten your back. Seem confident. Long strides to show Iâ€™m not afraid of whatâ€™s to come. No sounds other than the rain pelting on my umbrella. I walk up the stairs, and reach for the door - this is it. The moment I waited for.</p>
