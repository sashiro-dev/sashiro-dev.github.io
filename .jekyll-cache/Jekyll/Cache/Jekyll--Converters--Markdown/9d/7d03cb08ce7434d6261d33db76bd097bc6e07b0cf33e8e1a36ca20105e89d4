I"«<p>Itâ€™s been about a month since I started working (and yes, I cheated on the previous postâ€™s date, fucking sue me), and Iâ€™d like to share my thoughts on different aspects of my experience so far, ranging from routine, work itself and the new people I met. Iâ€™ll separate them by sections so I donâ€™t end up with a 5000 word essay where people fall asleep after 3 lines, this isnâ€™t the English criminal law book.</p>
