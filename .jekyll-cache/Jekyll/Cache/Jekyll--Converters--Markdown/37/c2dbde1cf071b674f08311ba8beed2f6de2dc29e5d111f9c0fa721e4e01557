I"à	<p>So, this is it. After the dozens of ads researched, the CVs sent, the â€œYeah we donâ€™t need you right now, weâ€™ll call you if we do though, xoxoâ€ and the Skype interviews, someone was willing to give me an opportunity. And Iâ€™d be damned if I didnâ€™t grasp it with all I had. The contract conditions were good, the environment seemed awesome, and the work seemed exactly what I was looking for, so fate arranged my first day of work.
Look up. Straighten your back. Seem confident. Long strides to show Iâ€™m not afraid of whatâ€™s to come. No sounds other than the rain pelting on my umbrella. I walk up the stairs, and reach for the door - this is it. The moment I waited for.</p>

<h1 id="what-the">What theâ€¦?</h1>

<p>Crap, the door is locked. Thereâ€™s no doorbell in sight either. Itâ€™s exactly 4PM, so Iâ€™m definitely on time.
I went back, and looked for a security guard. As I spotted one, I walked towards him to ask if he knew if there was someone in the office building. Oh, did I say â€œaskâ€? I meant â€œshoutâ€.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s an important detail I havenâ€™t mentioned yet: itâ€™s 2020, and Corona-chan decided to grace us with her presence. Social distancing is a thing, it is illegal to stand in a 2m radius of another human being.</p>

<p>The security guard confirmed there was indeed someone inside, so I went back to the locked door. Luckily, a woman spotted me at the entrance and signaled for me to go around the back. After some back and forth walking I finally found the back of the office and the woman held the door for me to enter.</p>

<p>The office was desert. Corona-chan was too beautiful for mortal hearts, so humans dared not to leave their homes and gaze upon her. Everyone, with the exception of a few brave ones, was working from their houses.</p>

<p>What ensued lasted about 2 minutes. I was handed a laptop, told that everything was set up, to attend a meeting at 10AM, and go back home. Contract would be signed virtually as well.
This was definitely not what I expected of my first day as a software engineer. I imagined an awkward walk up to my new teammates, getting introduced to them, grabbing some coffee and some presentation about what Iâ€™d be doing concretely. Not someone giving me a laptop and kick in the ass. Regardless, I was happy to finally begin working in a field Iâ€™m passionate about.</p>

<p>As my favorite samurai once said â€œSometimes, no matter what we do, we are victims of the circumstances. We should just have to pull ourselves outâ€.</p>
